# Conway-game-of-life
This cellular automaton is very interesting as I will state Stephen Wolfram "How basic rules could generate very complex systems"

Furthermore here the first interesting point is the comparaison between C++ and the same algorithm done in Python.

The C++ algorithm requires SDL2 library.
